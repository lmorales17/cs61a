  <h3>Introduction</h3>

  <p>In this project, you will develop an interpreter for a subset of the
  Scheme language. As you proceed, think about the issues that arise in the
  design of a programming language; many quirks of languages are the byproduct
  of implementation decisions in interpreters and compilers. </p>

  <p>You will also implement some small programs in Scheme, including the
  <code>count_change</code> function that we studied in lecture. Scheme is a simple but
  powerful functional language. You should find that much of what you have learned about
  Python transfers cleanly to Scheme as well as to other programming languages. To learn
  more about Scheme, you can read the original <a href=
  "http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-4.html#%_toc_start">Structure
  and Interpretation of Computer Programs</a> online for free. Examples from
  chapters 1 and 2 are included as test cases for this project. Language
  features from Chapters 3, 4, and 5 are not part of this project, but of
  course you are welcome to extend your interpreter to implement more of the
  language. Since we only include a subset of the language, your interpreter
  will not match exactly the behavior of other interpreters such as STk.</p>

  <p>The project concludes with an open-ended graphics contest that challenges you to
  produce recursive images in only a few lines of Scheme. As an example of what you might
  create, the picture above abstractly depicts all the ways of making change for $0.50
  using U.S. currency. All flowers appear at the end of a branch with length 50. Small
  angles in a branch indicate an additional coin, while large angles indicate a new
  currency denomination. In the contest, you too will have the chance to unleash your
  inner recursive artist.</p>

  <p>This project includes several files, but all of your changes will be made to the
  first three: <code><a href="scheme.py.html">scheme.py</a></code>, <code><a href="scheme_reader.py.html">scheme_reader.py</a></code>, and
  <code><a href="tests.scm">tests.scm</a></code>.  You can download all of the
  project code as a <a href="scheme.zip">zip archive</a>.</p>

  <h3>Logistics</h3>

  <p>This is a two-part project. As in the previous project, you'll work in a
  team of two people, person A and person B. All questions are labeled
  sequentially, but some are designated for certain people by a prefix of their
  letter (A or B). Both partners should understand the solutions to all
  questions.</p>

  <p>In the first part, you will develop the interpreter in stages:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Reading Scheme expressions</li>

    <li>Primitive procedure calls</li>

    <li>Symbol evaluation and definition</li>

    <li>Lambda expressions and procedure definition</li>

    <li>Calling user-defined procedures</li>

    <li>Evaluation of various special forms</li>
  </ul>

  <p>In the second part, you will implement Scheme procedures that are similar
  to some exercises that you previously completed in Python.</p>

  <p>There are 27 possible correctness points and 3 composition points. The
  composition score in this project will evaluate the clarity of your code
  <i>and</i> your ability to write tests that verify the behavior of your
  interpreter.  </p>

  <h3>The Scheme Language</h3>

  <p>Before you begin working on the project, review what you have learned in lecture
  about the Scheme language in <a href=
  "http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a-tz/book/chapters/interpretation.html#functional-programming">Chapter
  3.5</a> of the course lecture notes.

  <p><b>Read-Eval-Print.</b> Run interactively, the interpreter reads Scheme
  expressions, evaluates them, and prints the results. The interpreter uses
  <code>scm&gt;</code> as the prompt.</p>

  <pre>
    scm&gt; 2
    2
    scm&gt; (((lambda (f) (lambda (x) (f f x)))
          (lambda (f k) (if (zero? k) 1 (* k (f f (- k 1)))))) 5)
    120
  </pre>

  <p>The starter code for your Scheme interpreter in <code><a href="scheme.py.html">scheme.py</a></code>
  can successfully evaluate the first expression above, since it consists of a
  single literal numeral. The second (a computation of 5 factorial) will not
  work just yet.</p>

  <p><b>Load.</b> Our <code>load</code> function differs from standard Scheme
  in that we use a symbol for the file name. For example,</p>

  <pre>
    scm&gt; (load 'tests)
  </pre>

  <p><b>Symbols.</b> Unlike some implementations of Scheme, in this project
  numbers and boolean values cannot be used as symbols.  Symbols may not be
  capitalized.

  <p><b>Turtle Graphics.</b> In addition to standard Scheme procedures, we
  include procedure calls to the Python <code>turtle</code> package. Read its
  <a href=
    "http://docs.python.org/py3k/library/turtle.html">documentation</a>.</p>

  <p><u>Note</u>: The <code>turtle</code> Python module may not
  be installed by default on your personal computer. However, the
  <code>turtle</code> module is installed on the instructional machines.
  So, if you wish to create turtle graphics for this project (i.e. for
  the contest), then you'll either need to setup <code>turtle</code> on
  your personal computer, or test on your class account. </p>

  <h3>Testing</h3>

  <p>The tests for this project are largely taken from the Scheme
  textbook that 61A used for many years. Examples from relevant
  chapters (and a few more examples to test various corner cases)
  appear in <code><a href="tests.scm">tests.scm</a></code>.</p>

  <p>You can also compare the output of your interpreter to the expected output
  by running <code><a href="scheme_test.py.html">scheme_test.py</a></code>.</p>

  <pre>
    python3 scheme_test.py
  </pre>

  <p>The <code><a href="tests.scm">tests.scm</a></code> file contains Scheme
  expressions interspersed with comments in the form:

  <pre>
    (+ 1 2)
    ; expect 3
    (/ 1 0)
    ; expect Error
  </pre>

  <p> Above, <code><a href="scheme_test.py.html">scheme_test.py</a></code> will evaluate <code>(+ 1 2)</code>
  using your code in <code><a href="scheme.py.html">scheme.py</a></code>, then output a test failure
  if <code>3</code> is not returned.  The second example tests for an error
  (but not the specific error message).  The <code>scheme_test</code> script
  collects these expected outputs and compares them with the actual output from
  the program, counting and reporting mismatches.

  <p>Only a small subset of tests are designated to run by default because
  <code>tests.scm</code> contains an <code>(exit)</code> call near the
  beginning, which halts testing.  As you complete more of the project, you
  should move or remove this call. <i>Note that your interpreter doesn't know
  how to exit until Problems 3 and 4 are completed.</i>

  <p><b>Important</b>: As you proceed in the project, add new tests to the top
  of <code>tests.scm</code> to verify the behavior of your implementation.

  <p>Finally, as always, you can run the doctests for the project using:

  <pre>
    python3 -m doctest scheme.py scheme_reader.py
  </pre>

  <p>Don't forget to use the <code>trace</code> decorator from the
  <code>ucb</code> module to follow the path of execution in your
  interpreter.</p>

  <p>As you develop your Scheme interpreter, you may find that Python raises
  various uncaught exceptions when evaluating Scheme expressions. As a result,
  your Scheme interpreter will crash. Some of these may be the results of bugs
  in your program, and some may be useful indications of errors in user
  programs. The former should be fixed (of course!) and the latter should be
  caught and changed into <code>SchemeError</code> exceptions, which are caught
  and printed as error messages by the Scheme read-eval-print loop we've
  written for you. Python exceptions that "leak out" to the user in raw form
  are errors in your interpreter (tracebacks are for implementors, not
  civilians).</p>

  <h3>Running Your Scheme Interpreter</h3>

  <p> To run your Scheme interpreter in an interactive mode, type:

  <pre>
    python3 scheme.py
  </pre>

  Alternately, you can tell your Scheme interpreter to evaluate the
  lines of an input file by passing the file name as an argument to
  <code><a href="scheme.py.html">scheme.py</a></code>:

  <pre>
    python3 scheme.py tests.scm
  </pre>

  Currently, your Scheme interpreter can handle a few simple expressions, such
  as:

  <pre>
    scm> 1
    1
    scm> 42
    42
    scm> #t
    True
  </pre>

  To exit the Scheme interpreter, issue either <code>Ctrl-c</code> or
  <code>Ctrl-d</code> or evaluate the <code>exit</code> procedure:

  <pre>
    scm> (exit)
  </pre>

  <h3>The Reader</h3>

  <p>The function <code>scheme_read</code> in <code><a href="scheme_reader.py.html">scheme_reader.py</a></code>
  parses a <code>Buffer</code> (<code><a href="buffer.py.html">buffer.py</a></code>) instance that returns
  valid Scheme tokens on invocations of <code>current</code> and
  <code>pop</code> methods. It returns the next full Scheme expression in the
  <code>src</code> buffer, using an internal representation as follows:

  <table border="1" align="center">
  <tr>
  <th> Scheme Data Type</th>
  <th> Our Internal Representation </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> Numbers </td>
    <td> Python's built-in <code>int</code> and <code>float</code> data types.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> Symbols </td>
    <td> Python's built-in <code>string</code> data type. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
     <td> Booleans (<code>#t</code>, <code>#f</code>)</td>
     <td> Python's built-in <code>True</code>, <code>False</code>
     values. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
     <td> Pairs </td>
     <td> The <code>Pair</code> class, defined in the
       <code><a href="scheme_reader.py.html">scheme_reader.py</a></code> file. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
     <td> nil </td>
     <td> The <code>nil</code> object, defined in the
       <code><a href="scheme_reader.py.html">scheme_reader.py</a></code> file. </td>
  </tr>
  </table>

  <p><b>Problem 1</b> (1 pt). Complete the <code>scheme_read</code> function in
  <code><a href="scheme_reader.py.html">scheme_reader.py</a></code> by adding support for quotation.

  <ul>
    <li> If the next token in <code>src</code> is the string
    <code>"nil"</code>, return the <code>nil</code> object. (provided)
    <li> If the next token is not a delimiter, then it is an atom.  Return it.
    (provided)
    <li> If the current token refers to the beginning of a <b>quote</b> (such
    as <code>'bagel</code>), then treat the quoted symbol as the special form
    <code>(quote bagel)</code>.
    <li> If the current token is a left parenthesis <code>"("</code>, return
    the result of <code>read_tail</code>. (provided)
  </ul>

  <p><b>Problem 2</b> (2 pt). Complete the <code>read_tail</code> function in
  <code><a href="scheme_reader.py.html">scheme_reader.py</a></code> by adding support for dotted lists. A dotted
  list in Scheme is not necessarily a well-formed list, but instead has an
  arbitrary <code>second</code> attribute that may be any Scheme value.

  <p>The <code>read_tail</code> function expects to read the rest of a list or
  dotted list, assuming the open parenthesis has already been popped by
  <code>scheme_read</code>.

  <p>Consider the case of calling <code>scheme_read</code> on input "<code>(1 2
    . 3)</code>". The <code>read_tail</code> function will be called on the
  suffix "<code>1 2 . 3)</code>", which is</p>

  <ul>
    <li>the pair consisting of the Scheme value <code>1</code> and the value of the tail
    "<code>2 . 3)</code>", which is
      <ul>
        <li>the pair consisting of the Scheme value <code>2</code> and the Scheme value
        <code>3</code>.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  Thus, <code>read_tail</code> would return <code>Pair(1, Pair(2, 3))</code>.

  <p><i>Hint:</i> In order to verify that only one element follows a dot, after
  encountering a <code>'.'</code>, read one additional expression and then
  check to see that a closing parenthesis follows.

  <p>To verify that your solutions to Problem 1 and 2 work correctly, run the
  doctests for <code><a href="scheme_reader.py.html">scheme_reader.py</a></code> and test your parser interactively
  by running,

  <pre>
    # python3 scheme_reader.py
    read> 42
    42
    read> '(1 2 3)
    (quote (1 2 3))
    read> nil
    ()
    read> '()
    (quote ())
    read> (1 (2 3) (4 (5)))
    (1 (2 3) (4 (5)))
    read> (1 (9 8) . 7)
    (1 (9 8) . 7)
    read> (hi there . (cs . (student)))
    (hi there cs student)
  </pre>

  <h3>The Evaluator</h3>

  <p><b>All further changes to the interpreter will be made in
    <code><a href="scheme.py.html">scheme.py</a></code>. For each question, add a few tests to the top of
    <code>tests.scm</code> to verify the behavior of your implementation.</b>

  <p><a
    href="http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a-tz/book/chapters/interpretation.html#interpreters-for-languages-with-abstraction">Chapter
    3.7</a> of the course lecture notes describes the structure of the Scheme
  evaluator. In the implementation given to you, the <code>scheme_eval</code>
  function is complete, but few of the functions or methods it uses are
  implemented. In fact, the evaluator can only evaluate self-evaluating
  expressions: numbers, booleans, and <code>nil</code>.

  <p><b>Problem 3</b> (2 pt). Implement <code>apply_primitive</code>, which is
  called by <code>scheme_apply</code> for <code>PrimitiveProcedures</code>.
  Primitive procedures are applied by calling a corresponding Python function
  that implements the procedure.

  <p> Scheme primitive procedures are represented as instances of the
  <code>PrimitiveProcedure</code> class, defined in
  <code><a href="scheme_primitives.py.html">scheme_primitives.py</a></code>. A <code>PrimitiveProcedure</code> has two
  instance attributes:
  <ul>
    <li> <code>self.fn</code> is the <emph>Python</emph> function that
    implements the primitive Scheme procedure.
    <li> <code>self.use_env</code> is a boolean flag that indicates whether or
    not this primitive procedure will expect the current environment to be
    passed in as the last argument. The environment is required, for instance,
    to implement the primitive <code>eval</code> procedure.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>To see a list of all Scheme primitive procedures used in the project, look
  in the <code><a href="scheme_primitives.py.html">scheme_primitives.py</a></code> file. Any function decorated with
  <code>@primitive</code> will be added to the globally-defined
  <code>_PRIMITIVES</code> list. </p>

  <p>The <code>apply_primitive</code> function takes a
  <code>PrimitiveProcedure</code> instance, a Scheme list of argument values,
  and the current environment.  Your implementation should:

  <ul>
    <li> Convert the Scheme list to a Python list of arguments.

    <li> If the <code>procedure.use_env</code> is <code>True</code>, then
    add the current environment <code>env</code> as the last argument.

    <li> Call <code>procedure.fn</code> on those arguments (<i>hint</i>: use *
    notation).

    <li> If calling the function results in a <code>TypeError</code> exception
    being thrown, then raise a <code>SchemeError</code> instead.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The doctest for <code>apply_primitive</code> should now pass. However,
  your Scheme interpreter will still not be able to apply primitive
  procedures, because your Scheme interpreter still doesn't know
  how to look up the values for the primitive procedure symbols (such as
  <code>+</code>, <code>*</code>, and <code>car</code>).

  <p><b>Problem 4</b> (2 pt) Implement the <code>lookup</code> method of the
  <code>Frame</code> class. It takes a symbol (Python string) and returns the
  value bound to that name in the first frame of the environment in which it is
  found.  A <code>Frame</code> represents an environment via two instance
  attributes:

  <ul>
    <li> <code>self.bindings</code> is a dictionary that maps Scheme symbols
    (represented as Python strings) to Scheme values.
    <li> <code>self.parent</code> is the parent <code>Frame</code>
    instance. The parent of the Global Frame is <code>None</code>.
  </ul>

  Your <code>lookup</code> implementation should,

  <ul>
    <li> Return the value of a symbol in <code>self.bindings</code> if it exists.
    <li> Otherwise, <code>lookup</code> that symbol in the parent if it exists.
    <li> Otherwise, raise a <code>SchemeError</code>.
  </ul>

  <p>After you complete this problem, you should be able to evaluate primitive
  procedure calls, giving you the functionality of the Calculator language and
  more.</p>

  <pre>
    scm&gt; +
    #[primitive]
    scm> (+ 1 2)
    3
    scm> (* 3 4 (- 5 2) 1)
    36
    scm> (odd? 31)
    True
  </pre>

  <p><b>Problem A5</b> (1 pt). There are two missing parts in the method
  <code>do_define_form</code>, which handles the <code>(define&nbsp;...)</code>
  special forms.  Implement just the first part, which binds names to values
  but does not create new procedures. <code>do_define_form</code> should return
  the name after performing the binding.</p>

  <pre>
    scm&gt; (define tau (* 2 3.1415926))
    tau
  </pre>

  <p>You should now be able to give names to values and evaluate symbols to
  those values.

  <pre>
    scm&gt; (define x 15)
    x
    scm&gt; (define y (* 2 x))
    y
    scm&gt; y
    30
    scm&gt; (+ y (* y 2) 1)
    91
    scm&gt; (define x 20)
    x
    scm&gt; x
    20
  </pre>

  <p><b>Problem B6</b> (1 pt). Implement the <code>do_quote_form</code>
  function, which evaluates the <code>quote</code> special form. Once you have
  done so, you can evaluate quoted expressions.</p>

  <pre>
    scm&gt; 'hello
    hello
    scm&gt; '(1 . 2)
    (1 . 2)
    scm&gt; '(1 (2 three . (4 . 5)))
    (1 (2 three 4 . 5))
    scm&gt; (car '(a b))
    a
    scm&gt; (eval (cons 'car '('(1 2))))
    1
  </pre>

  <p> At this point in the project, your Scheme interpreter should be
  be able to support the following features:
    <ul>
      <li> Evaluate atoms, which include numbers, booleans, nil, and symbols,</li>
      <li> Evaluate the <code>quote</code> special form,</li>
      <li> Evaluate lists,</li>
      <li> Define symbols, and</li>
      <li> Call primitive procedures, such as <code>(+ (- 4 2) 5)</code> </li>
    </ul>

  <h3> User-Defined Procedures </h3>

  <p>In our interpreter, user-defined procedures will
  be represented as instances of the <code>LambdaProcedure</code> class,
  defined in <code><a href="scheme.py.html">scheme.py</a></code>. A <code>LambdaProcedure</code>
  instance has three instance attributes:

  <ul>
    <li> <code>self.formals</code> is a Scheme list of the formal
    parameters (symbols) that name the arguments of the procedure.
    <li> <code>self.body</code> is a single Scheme expression; the body of the
    procedure.
    <li> <code>self.env</code> is the environment in which the procedure was
    defined. </li>
  </ul>

  <p><b>Problem 7</b> (2 pt). Implement the <code>begin</code> special form,
  which has a list of one or more sub-expressions that are each evaluated in
  order.  The value of the final sub-expression is the value of the
  <code>begin</code> expression.

  <pre>
    scm&gt; (begin (+ 2 3) (+ 5 6))
    11
    scm&gt; (begin (display 3) (newline) (+ 2 3))
    3
    5
  </pre>

  <p> <u>Note</u>: When <code>scheme_eval</code> evaluates one of
  the conditional constructs (<code>if</code>, <code>and</code>,
  <code>or</code>, <code>cond</code>, <code>begin</code>,
  <code>case</code>), notice that it calls <code>scheme_eval</code>
  on the <b>return value</b> of the relevant <code>do_FORM</code>
  procedures (<code>do_begin_form</code>, <code>do_cond_form</code>, etc.).
  Take care that your Scheme interpreter doesn't inadvertantly call
  <code>scheme_eval</code> on the same value twice, or else you might
  get the following invalid behavior:

  <pre>
    scm> (begin 30 'hello)
    Error: unknown identifier: hello
  </pre>

  <p><b>Problem 8</b> (2 pt). Implement the <code>do_lambda_form</code> method,
  which creates <code>LambdaProcedure</code> values by evaluating
  <code>lambda</code> expressions. While you cannot call a user-defined
  procedure yet, you can verify that you have read the procedure correctly by
  evaluating a lambda expression.

  <pre>
    scm&gt; (lambda (x y) (+ x y))
    (lambda (x y) (+ x y))
  </pre>

  In Scheme, it is legal to have function bodies with more than one expression:

  <pre>
    STk> ((lambda (y) 42 (* y 2)) 5)
    10
  </pre>

  In order to implement this feature, your
  <code>do_lambda_form</code> should detect when the body of a lambda
  expression contains multiple expressions. If so, then
  <code>do_lambda_form</code> should place the expressions
  inside of a <code>(begin ...)</code> expression, and use that
  <code>begin</code> expression as the body:

  <pre>
    scm&gt; (lambda (y) 42 (* y 2))
    (lambda (y) (begin 42 (* y 2)))
  </pre>

  <p><b>Problem A9</b> (1 pt). Currently, your Scheme interpreter is
  able to define user-defined procedures in the following manner:

  <pre>
    scm&gt; (define f (lambda (x) (* x 2)))
    f
  </pre>

  However, we'd like to be able to use the shorthand form of defining
  procedures:

  <pre>
    scm&gt; (define (f x) (* x 2))
    f
  </pre>

  <p>Modify the <code>do_define_form</code> function so that it correctly
  handles the shorthand procedure definition form above. Make sure that it can
  handle multi-expression bodies. <i>Hint</i>: construct a <code>lambda</code>
  expression and evaluate it with <code>do_lambda_form</code>.

  <p>Once you have completed this problem, you should find that defined
  procedures evaluate to lambda procedures.

  <pre>
    scm&gt; (define (square x) (* x x))
    square
    scm&gt; square
    (lambda (x) (* x x))
  </pre>


  <p><b>Problem 10</b> (2 pt). Implement the <code>make_call_frame</code> method of
  the <code>Frame</code> class. It should do 2 things:

  <ul>
    <li> Creating a new Frame, the parent of which is <code>self</code> (done for you). </li>

    <li> Binding formal parameters to their associated argument values. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Make sure the number of arguments <code>make_call_frame</code> recieves is the same as the number of formal parameters it recieves.
  </p>

  <!--
  <p>Don't forget the cases where the formal parameter list contains a trailing "varargs"
  entry, as in:

  <pre>
    (define (format port form . args) ...)
  </pre>
  Which means that every (in this example) every argument passed to format after form
  will be stuffed into a scheme list which the symbol <code>args</code> is bound to.
  One unifying way to handle this case along with the simple lists-of-symbols is to
  consider the formals list as a kind of <i>pattern</i> that is matched against the list
  of argument values. That is, the formals list <i>matches</i> the argument list if you
  treat each symbol in the formals list as a <i>pattern variable</i> or <i>wildcard</i>
  that matches any expression. Thus, the list of values <code>(1 2 3)</code> has the
  internal structure

  <pre>
    Pair(<i>number</i>, Pair(<i>number</i>, Pair(<i>number</i>, NULL)))
  </pre>

  while the formals list <code>(a . b)</code> has the structure

  <pre>
    Pair(<i>symbol a</i>, <i>symbol b</i>)
  </pre>

  These have the same form if we match symbol <code>a</code> to the number 1 and
  symbol <code>b</code> to <code>Pair(<i>number</i>, Pair(<i>number</i>, NULL))</code>
  Likewise, the ordinary formals list <code>(a b c)</code> has the structure

  <pre>
    Pair(<i>symbol a</i>, Pair(<i>symbol b</i>, Pair(<i>symbol c</i>, NULL)))
  </pre>

  so it matches the argument list, too.

  <p><b>Problem B11</b> (1 pt). Implement the <code>check_formals</code>
  function to raise an error whenever the Scheme list of formal parameters
  passed to it is invalid.  Raise a <code>SchemeError</code> if the list of
  <code>formals</code> is not a well-formed list of symbols or if any symbol is
  repeated. (Hint: Look inside of <code><a href="scheme_primitives.py.html">scheme_primitives.py</a></code> for a function that tells you something is a scheme symbol. )
  </p>

  <!--
  <p>
  In particular, make sure that it supports the following argument
  syntax:
  <pre>
scm> (lambda (x y z) (+ x y z))
scm> (lambda (x . nums) (* x (reduce + nums)))
scm> (lambda nums (reduce * nums))
  </pre>

  Make sure that your interpreter rejects the following. Where
  your interpeter rejects the following is not important (i.e. in
  <tt>scheme_read</tt> or <tt>check_formals</tt>),
  as long as you are correctly raising some <tt>SchemeError</tt>. It is
  an error for your interpreter to raise a Python exception.

  <pre>
scm> (lambda (x (y) z) (* x y z))
scm> (define (fn x 2) (+ x 2))
  </pre>
  </p>
  -->

  <p><b>Problem 12</b> (2 pt). Implement <code>scheme_apply</code> to correctly
  apply user-defined <code>LambdaProcedure</code> instances. (The case of
  <code>MuProcedures</code> is handled later in the project). It should:

  <ul>
    <li> Create a new <code>Frame</code>, with all formal parameters
    bound to their argument values.

    <li> Evaluate the body of <code>procedure</code> in the environment
    represented by this new frame.

    <li> Return the value of calling <code>procedure</code>.
  </ul>

  <p>After you complete <code>scheme_apply</code>, user-defined functions (and
  lambda functions) should work in your Scheme interpreter.  Now is an
  excellent time to revisit the tests in <code>tests.scm</code> and ensure that
  you pass the ones that involve definition (Sections 1.1.2 and 1.1.4).  You
  should also add additional tests of your own to verify that your interpreter
  is behaving as you expect.

  <h3>Special Forms</h3>

  <p>The basic Scheme logical special forms are <code>if</code>,
  <code>and</code>, <code>or</code>, and <code>cond</code>. These expressions
  are special because not all of their sub-expressions may be evaluated.

  <p>In Scheme, only <code>#f</code> (also known as <code>false</code> or
  <code>False</code>) is a false value.  All other values are true values. You
  can test whether a value is a true value or a false value using the provided
  Python functions <code>scheme_true</code> and <code>scheme_false</code>,
  defined in <code><a href="scheme_primitives.py.html">scheme_primitives.py</a></code>.

  <p><b>Problem A13</b> (1 pt). Implement <code>do_if_form</code> so that
  <code>if</code> expressions are evaluated correctly. This function should
  return either the second (consequent) or third (alternative) expression of
  the <code>if</code> expression, depending on the value of the first
  (predicate) expression.

  <pre>
    scm&gt; (if (= 4 2) true false)
    False
    scm&gt; (if (= 4 4) (* 1 2) (+ 3 4))
    2
  </pre>

  <p>It is legal to pass in just two expressions to the <code>if</code> special
  form. In this case, you should return the second expression if the first
  expression evaluates to a true value. Otherwise, return the special
  <code>okay</code> value, which represents an undefined value.

  <pre>
    scm&gt; (if (= 4 2) true)
    okay
  </pre>

  <p><b>Problem B14</b> (2 pt). Implement <code>do_and_form</code> and
  <code>do_or_form</code> so that <code>and</code> and <code>or</code>
  expressions are evaluated correctly.

  <p>The logical forms <code>and</code> and <code>or</code> are <i>short-
  circuiting</i>. For <code>and</code>, your interpreter should evaluate each
  sub-expression from left to right, and if any of these evaluates to
  <code>False</code>, then <code>False</code> is returned.  If all but the last
  sub-expressions evaluate to true values, return the last sub-expression from
  <code>do_and_form</code>.</p>

  <p>For <code>or</code>, evaluate each sub-expression from left to right. If any
  evaluates to a true value, then <code>quote</code> that value and return it.
  These return values must be quoted because they are evaluated in
  <code>scheme_eval</code>.  If all but the last sub-expression evaluate to
  false, return the last sub-expression from <code>do_or_form</code> without
  quoting it.</p>

  <pre>
    scm&gt; (and)
    True
    scm&gt; (or)
    False
    scm&gt; (and 4 5 6)
    6    ; all operands are true values
    scm&gt; (or 5 2 1)
    5    ; 5 is a true value
    scm&gt; (and #t #f 42 (/ 1 0))
    False    ; short-circuiting behavior of and
    scm&gt; (or 4 #t (/ 1 0))
    4    ; short-circuiting behavior of or
  </pre>

  <p><b>Problem A15</b> (1 pt). Implement <code>do_cond_form</code> so that it
  returns the first result sub-expression corresponding to a true predicate (or
  else). Your implementation should match the following examples and the
  additional tests in <code>tests.scm</code>.

  <pre>
    scm&gt; (cond ((= 4 3) 'nope)
              ((= 4 4) 'hi)
              (else 'wait))
    hi
    scm&gt; (cond ((= 4 3) 'wat)
              ((= 4 4))
              (else 'hm))
    True
    scm&gt; (cond ((= 4 4) 'here 42)
              (else 'wat 0))
    42
  </pre>

  For the last example, where the body of a <code>cond</code> has multiple
  expressions, you might find it helpful to replace <code>cond</code>-bodies
  with multiple expression bodies into a single <code>begin</code> expression,
  i.e., the following two expressions are equivalent.

  <pre>
    (cond ((= 4 4) 'here 42))
    (cond ((= 4 4) (begin 'here 42)))
  </pre>

  <p>The value of a <code>cond</code> is undefined if there are no true
  predicates and no <code>else</code>. In such a case, <code>do_cond_form</code>
  should return <code>okay</code>.</p>

  <p><b>Problem A16</b> (2 pt). The <code>let</code> special form introduces local
  variables, giving them their initial values. For example,</p>

  <pre>
    scm&gt; (define x 'hi)
    x
    scm&gt; (define y 'bye)
    y
    scm&gt; (let ((x 42)
              (y (* 5 10)))
          (list x y))
    (42 50)
    scm&gt; (list x y)
    (hi bye)
  </pre>

  Implement
  the <code>do_let_form</code> method to have this effect and test it, by
  adding test cases to <code>tests.scm</code>. Make sure your <code>let</code>
  correctly handles multi-expression bodies:

  <pre>
    scm&gt; (let ((x 42)) x 1 2)
    2
  </pre>

  <p> The let special form is equivalent to creating and then calling a lambda
  procedure. That is, the following two expressions are equivalent:

  <pre>
    (let ((x 42) (y 16)) (+ x y))
    ((lambda (x y) (+ x y)) 42 16)
  </pre>

  Thus, a <code>let</code> form implicitly creates a new
  <code>Frame</code> (containing the <code>let</code> bindings)
  which extends the current environment and evaluates the body of the
  <code>let</code> with respect to this new <code>Frame</code>. This is
  very much exactly like a user-defined function call. Note that, in your
  project code, you don't have to actually create a
  <code>LambdaProcedure</code> and call it. Instead, you can
  create a new <code>Frame</code>, add the necessary bindings, and
  evaluate the expressions of the <code>let</code> body with respect to
  the new <code>Frame</code>.</p>

  <p>The bindings created by a <code>let</code> are not able to refer back to
  previously-declared bindings from the same <code>let</code>.

  <p><b>Problem B17</b> (2 pt). Implement <code>do_mu_form</code> to evaluate
  the <code>mu</code> special form, a non-standard Scheme expression type. A
  <code>mu</code> expression is similar to a <code>lambda</code> expression,
  but evaluates to a <code>MuProcedure</code> instance that is dynamically
  scoped. The <code>MuProcedure</code> class has been provided for you.

  <p>Additionally, complete <code>scheme_apply</code> to call
  <code>MuProcedure</code> procedures using dynamic scoping.  Calling a
  <code>LambdaProcedure</code> uses lexical scoping: the parent of the new call
  frame is the environment in which the procedure was defined. Calling a
  <code>MuProcedure</code> created by a <code>mu</code> expression uses dynamic
  scoping:  the parent of the new call frame is the environment in which the
  call expression was evaluated.  As a result, a <code>MuProcedure</code> does
  not need to store an environment as an instance attribute.  It can refer to
  names in the environment from which it was called.

  <pre>
    scm&gt; (define f (mu (x) (+ x y)))
    f
    scm&gt; (define g (lambda (x y) (f (+ x x))))
    g
    scm&gt; (g 3 7)
    13
  </pre>

  <p>Your Scheme interpreter implementation is now complete.  You should have
  been adding tests to <code>tests.scm</code> as you did each problem.  These
  tests will be evaluated as part of your composition score for the project.
  Make sure that your project works as expected.

  <h3>Part 3: Write Some Scheme</h3>

  <p>Not only is your Scheme interpreter itself a tree-recursive program, but it is
  flexible enough to evaluate <i>other</i> recursive programs. Implement the following
  procedures in Scheme at the bottom of <code><a
      href="tests.scm">tests.scm</a></code>.</p>

  <p><b>Problem 18</b> (2 pt). Implement the <code>merge</code> procedure, which
  takes in a comparator and two sorted list arguments and combines them into one
  sorted list. A <emph>comparator</emph> is a function that compares two values.
  For example:

  <pre>
    scm&gt; (merge < '(1 4 6) '(2 5 8))
    (1 2 4 5 6 8)
    scm&gt; (merge > '(6 4 1) '(8 5 2))
    (8 6 5 4 2 1)
  </pre>

  <p><b>Problem A19</b> (2 pt). Implement the <code>count-change</code> procedure, which
  counts all of the ways to make change for a <code>total</code> amount, using coins with
  various denominations (<code>denoms</code>), but never uses more than
  <code>max-coins</code> in total.  The procedure definition line is provided
  in <code>tests.scm</code>, along with a list of U.S. denominations.</p>

  <p><b>Problem B20</b> (2 pt) Implement the <code>count-partitions</code> procedure,
  which counts all the ways to partition a positive integer <code>total</code> using only
  pieces less than or equal to another positive integer <code>max-value</code>. The
  number <code>5</code> has 5 partitions using pieces up to a <code>max-value</code> of
  <code>3</code>:</p>

  <pre>
    3, 2 (two pieces)
    3, 1, 1 (three pieces)
    2, 2, 1 (three pieces)
    2, 1, 1, 1 (four pieces)
    1, 1, 1, 1, 1 (five pieces)
  </pre>

  <p><b>Problem 21</b> (2 pt). Implement the <code>list-partitions</code> procedure,
  which lists all of the ways to partition a positive integer <code>total</code> into at
  most <code>max-pieces</code> pieces that are all less than or equal to a positive
  integer <code>max-value</code>. <i>Hint</i>: Define a helper function to construct
  partitions.</p>

  <p><b>Problem 22</b> (0 pt). Implement the <code>hax</code> procedure that
  draws the following recursive illustration when passed two arguments, a side
  length <code>d</code> and recursive depth <code>k</code>.  The example below
  is drawn from <code>(hax 200 4)</code>.

  <div>
    <img alt="hax.png" src="hax.png" />
  </div>

  <p>To see how this illustration is constructed, consider this annotated
  version that gives the relative lengths of lines of the component shapes in
  the figure.

  <div>
    <img alt="h1.png" src="h1.png" />
  </div>

  <h3>Extra Credit</h3>

  <p><b>Problem 23</b> (2 pt). Complete the function
  <code>scheme_optimized_eval</code>
  in <code><a href="scheme.py.html">scheme.py</a></code>. This alternative to <code>scheme_eval</code> is
  properly tail recursive. That is, the interpreter will allow an unbounded
  number of active <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail_call>tail
    calls</a> in constant space.

  <p>Instead of recursively calling <code>scheme_eval</code> for tail calls and
  logical special forms, and <code>let</code>, replace the current
  <code>expr</code> and <code>env</code> with different expressions and
  environments. For call expressions, this change only applies to calling
  user-defined procedures.

  <p>Once you finish, uncomment the line
  <code>scheme_eval = scheme_optimized_eval</code> in <code><a href="scheme.py.html">scheme.py</a></code>.

  <p><b>Congratulations!</b> You have finished the final project for 61A! Assuming your
  tests are good and you've passed them all, consider yourself a proper computer
  scientist!</p>

  <p>Now, get some sleep. You've earned it!

  <h3><a name="art">Contest: Recursive Art</a></h3>

  <p>We've added a number of primitive drawing procedures that are collectively
  called "turtle graphics".  The <i>turtle</i> represents the state of the drawing
  module, which has a position, an orientation, a pen state (up or down), and a
  pen color. The <code>tscheme_<i>x</i></code> functions in
  <code><a href="scheme_primitives.py.html">scheme_primitives.py</a></code> are the implementations of these
  procedures, and show their parameters with a brief description of each.
  The Python <a
    href="http://docs.python.org/release/3.2/library/turtle.html">documentation of
    the turtle module</a> contains more detail.</p>

  <p><b>Contest</b>. Create a visualization of an iterative or recursive process
  of your choosing, using turtle graphics. Your implementation must be written
  entirely in Scheme using the interpreter you have built. However, you may add
  primitive procedures to interface with Python's turtle module. Other than that
  <i>all computation must be done in Scheme</i>.</p>
